# Creating a Hybrid AI Agent

A Hybrid Agent combines both **voice** and **text** capabilities, giving users the flexibility to chat or speak naturally. Follow this guide to set up your hybrid agent from start to finish.

## 🧩 1. Basic Configuration

### Fields:

- **Agent Name**: Internal reference for your AI agent.
- **Core Instructions**: Describe the main goal of this agent. You can use pre-built (or pre-defined templates) such as customer support agent, sales agent, technical support agent, live chat companion agent, lead qualification agent, hr specialist agent, and marketing agent.
- **Starter Questions**:
  - Shown as clickable prompts to guide users
- **Temperature**:
  - Controls creativity: `0 = more accurate`, `1 = more creative`

## 🎨 2. Appearance Settings

You can fully customize how your chatbot appears:

- **Bot Avatar**: Upload a profile image (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`).
- **Accent Color**: Widget’s theme color.
- **Position**: Left, Center, or Right of the screen.
- **Font**: Pick a font for all widget text (e.g., Times New Roman).
- **Widget Behavior**:
  - Toggle Wittify branding visibility.
  - Toggle whether the widget opens automatically.

## 🎙️ 3. Voice Settings

- **Voice Selection**: Pick a voice provider (e.g., ElevenLabs voice like “Sarah”).
- **Auto Detect Language**: Automatically switch language based on user speech.
- **Toggle Allow Interruption**: Allow user to interrupt while the agent is speaking.

### 🔧 Advanced Settings

- `End call on silence`: If there's no audio input from the user for 60 seconds, the call will automatically end.
- `Max call length`: The AI call will automatically end after 10 minutes, regardless of the conversation state.
- `Time before widget pop up`: Time delay before the AI widget appears on the screen after a trigger event.
- `min_speech_duration`: The shortest time the AI considers as valid speech from the user.
- `min_silence_duration`: Defines how long a pause must be before the AI interprets it as "silence" and possibly takes action.
