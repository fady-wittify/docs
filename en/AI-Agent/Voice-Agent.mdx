## 🎙️ 3. Voice Settings

Customize the voice of your AI agent to reflect your brand’s tone and personality. Wittify.AI provides a variety of multilingual voices, both male and female, to ensure a natural and localized user experience.

How to Choose a Voice:

1. Scroll through the available voice options.
2. Click Play Preview to listen to a sample.
3. Click Use Voice to apply it to your agent. The active voice will be marked as Used.

🔄 Auto Detect Language
Enable automatic language detection to switch dynamically based on the user’s speech input.

⏱ Allow Interruption
Enable this if you want users to interrupt the agent while it’s speaking — useful for faster, more natural conversation flow.

### 🔧 Advanced Settings

- `End call on silence`: If there's no audio input from the user for 60 seconds, the call will automatically end.
- `Max call length`: The AI call will automatically end after 10 minutes, regardless of the conversation state.
- `Time before widget pop up`: Time delay before the AI widget appears on the screen after a trigger event.
- `min_speech_duration`: The shortest time the AI considers as valid speech from the user.
- `min_silence_duration`: Defines how long a pause must be before the AI interprets it as "silence" and possibly takes action.
