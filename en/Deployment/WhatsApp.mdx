## 🧠 The Human Takeover Feature

Wittify allows you to **manually take control** of any WhatsApp conversation — ideal when AI isn’t enough or when you want to give users a more personal experience.

Human Takeover works on a per-conversation basis. You can easily switch between AI and human control from the Inbox view.

### ⚠️ Important Notes

* If a connected WhatsApp number is removed from **Tools > Integrations**, you will **lose takeover control** for that number’s conversations
* You will still have access to past messages in the **Chat Logs**, but the takeover icon will be disabled
* Reconnecting a number is treated as a new integration – avoid deleting unless necessary
