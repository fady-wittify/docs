
## 📸 Instagram

Deploying on Instagram with Wittify allows your custom AI Agent to **communicate directly with users via Instagram Direct Messages (DMs)** — automating responses, handling inquiries, and enabling human takeover whenever needed.

This creates a seamless support flow while keeping you in control of the conversation.

### ✅ What It Enables

* 🤖 Deliver instant AI-driven replies to common questions
* 💬 Allow **you or your team** to take over the conversation in real time

## 🔧 Connecting Instagram

Follow these steps to connect your AI Agent to Instagram:

1. Go to the **Deployments** tab
2. Select **Instagram** and click **Connect**
3. A permissions window will appear — choose the Instagram account you want to link
4. Grant the following permissions to `Wittify.ai-IG`:

## 🧠 The Human Takeover Feature

Sometimes you’ll want to personally respond to a user instead of the AI — that’s where **Human Takeover** comes in.

This feature allows you to **pause the agent** and step into any Instagram conversation manually.

---

### 🛠 How to Use Human Takeover

1. Navigate to the **Inbox** tab
2. In **Chat Logs**, filter by Instagram conversations only
3. Click the **Human Takeover icon** on the desired chat

   * This will stop the AI from responding in that conversation
4. Want to give control back to the agent? Just click the icon again ✅

### ⚠️ Important Notes

* If you delete a connected Instagram page from the **Tools > Integrations** tab, you will **lose the takeover control** for past conversations related to that page
* Even though you’ll still see past chats in the logs, **you won't be able to reassign takeover or re-engage the agent** for those unless the page is reconnected
* Deleting and re-adding the same Instagram page counts as a **new integration** — proceed carefully to avoid breaking existing threads
