It works on a conversation level meaning you would be able to choose a specific conversation from the dashboard and stop the Ai Agent from answering that conversation.

	**Note:** some conversations may not have the human takeover icon, that happens when you delete a page from the integrations dashboard, you would still have access to your conversations in the chat logs, 
	but since the integration was deleted you will not have access to the takeover feature since this page’s integration was deleted. 
	This will also happen if you delete a page and add it again, so be careful when deleting pages from the Instagram dashboard.

This capability allows multiple Ai Agents to manage different Instagram pages, providing specialized interactions for each page. here are the steps to adding different Ai Agents to different pages.

1. After connecting the first page(s) you should now have access to the **manage Instagram pages** integrations page. navigate to the Ai Agent you want to connect then **Activity > Integrations > manage.**

2. Click the **Manage** button to navigate to the dashboard. If you want to connect another Ai Agent to an already connected page, click, then delete the page.

3. Navigate to the Ai Agent you want to integrate to the page deleted, then reinitialize the integrations steps.

	**Note:** if you deleted a Ai Agent it will be selected in the integration steps, don’t deselect any Ai Agent you want to stay connected to the instagram or facebook integrations on Witify as deselecting the Ai Agent will result in disabling that Ai Agent for Witify.
