## Instagram

Integrating Instagram with Witify allows your custom Ai Agent to communicate directly with customers via your Instagram pages. This integration also enables you to take over the conversation whenever you want and communicate with users yourself through Instagram’s direct messaging. It provides a seamless and efficient way to handle inquiries and automate responses, while giving you the freedom to interact with your customers whenever you choose. 
This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to connect your Ai Agent to Instagram, ensuring smooth and effective customer interactions.

## **Connecting Instagram**

1. When creating an agent, Navigate to Deployments tab, then choose Instagram and click Connect
2. A permissions window will appear. Select the Instagram account you wish to connect.
3. Grant the following permissions to Wittify.ai-IG:

- ✅ View profile and access media (required)

- ✅ Access and manage comments

- ✅ Access and manage messages

- ✅ Access and publish content

- ✅ Access and manage insights

4. Click Allow to complete the integration.

Once connected, your AI agent will be able to respond to Instagram DMs, interact with users, and route messages to the inbox if needed.


## **The Human Takeover Feature**

The human takeover feature allows you to takeover the chat whenever you would like and chat with users yourself! 
It works on a conversation level meaning you would be able to choose a specific conversation from the dashboard and stop the Ai Agent from answering that conversation.

	**Note:** some conversations may not have the human takeover icon, that happens when you delete a page from the integrations dashboard, you would still have access to your conversations in the chat logs, 
	but since the integration was deleted you will not have access to the takeover feature since this page’s integration was deleted. 
	This will also happen if you delete a page and add it again, so be careful when deleting pages from the Instagram dashboard.
	
## **to enable human takeover for a specific conversation:**

1. Navigate to Activity either through the Navbar or through the messenger dashboard.

2. in the **Chat logs section** make sure to show only Instagram chats.

3. Click the human takeover icon.

4. You can click the icon again to restore access to the Ai Agent.

## **Connecting different Ai Agents to different pages**

With the Witify Instagram integration, you can connect different Ai Agents to various pages. 
This capability allows multiple Ai Agents to manage different Instagram pages, providing specialized interactions for each page. here are the steps to adding different Ai Agents to different pages.

1. After connecting the first page(s) you should now have access to the **manage Instagram pages** integrations page. navigate to the Ai Agent you want to connect then **Activity > Integrations > manage.**

2. Click the **Manage** button to navigate to the dashboard. If you want to connect another Ai Agent to an already connected page, click, then delete the page.

3. Navigate to the Ai Agent you want to integrate to the page deleted, then reinitialize the integrations steps.

	**Note:** if you deleted a Ai Agent it will be selected in the integration steps, don’t deselect any Ai Agent you want to stay connected to the instagram or facebook integrations on Witify as deselecting the Ai Agent will result in disabling that Ai Agent for Witify.
