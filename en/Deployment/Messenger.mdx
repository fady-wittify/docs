## 🧠 The Human Takeover Feature

The **Human Takeover** feature lets you step in and respond to users manually — temporarily pausing the chatbot for that specific conversation.

This works at a **conversation level**, meaning the AI will remain active for other chats unless manually disabled per conversation.

### ⚠️ Important Notes

* If you **delete a Messenger page** from the **Tools > Integrations** tab, you will **lose takeover access** for that page’s chats
* While you can still see chat logs, the **takeover icon will be disabled** for deleted integrations
* Deleting and re-adding the same page counts as a new integration, which resets the connection
* Always double-check before removing any Messenger page to avoid disruptions
