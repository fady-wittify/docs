# 📇 Lead Capture and Management 

Lead Capture allows your AI agent to automatically collect essential contact details — including **name, email, and phone number** — from users during live conversations. This ensures your business can follow up, qualify leads, or route users to the right destination based on accurate, real-time data.
Lead Capture is located under the Tools tab and works seamlessly across all your deployed agents.

## ✅ What This Tool Enables

- Prompt users during conversations to share their contact details
- Automatically collect amd store leads with name, email, and phone number
- Ensure no incomplete data: the agent asks for any missing fields
- Personalize your lead request message using custom instructions
- View and manage all captured leads in one place
- Use captured data in campaigns

## 💡 Ideal For

- Sales teams qualifying inbound prospects
- Support teams needing user details for follow-up
- Marketers running outreach or activation campaigns
- Any business that wants to convert conversations into actionable leads

## 🔧 How to Set Up

1. When creating an agent, navigate to **Integrations & Tools** tab
2. Scroll to **Leads Capture** and toggle it to **Active**
3. Add a custom prompt in the **Additional Instructions** field (optional)
✏️ Example: “Could you please share your email and phone number so we can assist you further?”
