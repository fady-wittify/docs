# 📇 Lead Capture

Lead Capture allows your AI agent to automatically collect essential contact details — including name, email, and phone number — from users during live conversations. This ensures your business can follow up, qualify leads, or route users to the right destination based on accurate, real-time data.
Lead Capture is located under the Tools tab and works seamlessly across all your deployed agents.

## ✅ What This Tool Enables

- Prompt users during conversations to share their contact details
- Automatically store leads with name, email, and phone number
- Ensure no incomplete data: the agent asks for any missing fields
- Personalize your lead request message using custom instructions

## 💡 Ideal For

- Sales teams qualifying inbound prospects
- Support teams needing user details for follow-up
- Businesses capturing leads from live chat

## 🔧 How to Set Up

1. When creating an agent, navigate to **Tools** tab
2. Scroll to **Leads Capture** and toggle it to **Active**
3. Add a custom prompt in the **Additional Instructions** field (optional)
✏️ Example: “Could you please share your email and phone number so we can assist you further?”
4. Click **Save Changes** to activate

## 🔍 How It Works

 - When the agent starts a conversation, it asks the user to provide their name, email, and phone number
 - If the user skips any field, the agent will automatically request the missing information
 - All captured data is stored securely and can be accessed through **Captured Leads** and can be used for **Campaigns**
