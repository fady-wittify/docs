## 🧠 General Agent Building Tips

- **Define clear use cases**: Before building an agent, outline specific user intents and flows.
- **Use descriptive agent names**: It helps in managing and distinguishing between multiple agents.
- **Leverage prebuilt flows**: Use templates or past agents to accelerate setup for common tasks.

## 🎙 Voice Agent Best Practices

- **Check mic and audio permissions**: Ensure browser or app-level permissions are granted for microphone access.
- **Test response delays**: Use preview mode to confirm voice response timing is natural.
- **Customize tone and pacing**: Adjust voice settings to reflect your brand’s communication style.

## 💬 Text Agent Best Practices

- **Use short, clear prompts**: Write concise prompts to avoid confusing the AI.
- **Enable fallback messages**: Ensure there’s a default message for unrecognized queries.
- **Add quick replies**: Help users stay on track and guide them through interactions.

## 🧪 Hybrid Agent Best Practices

- **Balance text and voice flows**: Ensure the hybrid agent handles transitions smoothly between modalities.
- **Use adaptive response types**: Tailor output based on user context (e.g., silent environments favor text).
- **Test on real scenarios**: Simulate user behavior to uncover edge cases early.

## 🌐 Integration Best Practices

- **Use verified API keys**: Ensure all integrations (e.g., WhatsApp, Instagram) are using secure credentials.
- **Follow official docs**: Reference integration documentation for the latest setup instructions.
- **Test authentication**: Verify that token or webhook setups are secure and reliable.
