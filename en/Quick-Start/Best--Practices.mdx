## 🌟 Best Practices for Building Your AI Agent

Creating a powerful AI agent with Wittify is simple — but creating one that truly engages users, captures leads, and represents your brand effectively requires a few thoughtful steps.

Here are the best practices to follow when setting up your chatbot or voice agent.

---

### 🧠 1. Define the Agent’s Purpose Clearly

Before you start building, ask:

* Is the agent for **support**, **lead generation**, **bookings**, or **sales**?

Knowing this will shape how you write instructions, choose tone, and design flows.

---

### 🗂 2. Use a Focused Knowledge Base

Your agent should sound smart — but not overloaded.

* Upload **only the files or URLs** that are relevant to the use case
* Split large documents into smaller, targeted ones
* Avoid giving access to full websites unless truly needed
* Use **headings and structure** in uploaded content for best scanning

📌 Tip: Keep your knowledge base up to date — outdated answers kill trust.

---

### 🗣 3. Write Strong Core Instructions

Use the Core Instructions field to guide the AI’s personality and behavior.

Example template:

> “You are a helpful support agent for \[Company Name]. Answer clearly and concisely. If the user asks about pricing, direct them to the pricing page. If you don’t know the answer, say so politely.”

Include:

* Role
* Tone
* What to avoid
* Fallback behavior

---

### 🛠 4. Customize the Experience

Make it feel on-brand and easy to use:

* Update the **Welcome Message** and **Input Placeholder**
* Use a friendly but professional tone
* Add a **disclaimer** to set expectations (e.g., “I’m AI-powered, so I may make mistakes.”)
* Choose a name that fits your brand voice (e.g., “Witty” or “Aura”)

---

### 🎯 5. Capture Leads Early

If your agent is meant to convert or qualify users:

* Turn on **Lead Capture**
* Set a friendly but clear message like:

  > “Can you share your name, email, and phone number so we can follow up?”

Agents will prompt again if any info is missing.

---

### 🤝 6. Integrate with Tools

Maximize your agent’s power by connecting it to:

* **Calendars** (Google, Calendly, Cal) for booking
* **CRMs** like Salesforce
* **WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, or Web Widgets** for deployment

---

### 📊 7. Monitor Conversations

Use the **Inbox** to review how your agent performs:

* See what users are asking
* Check for common fallback answers
* Use this data to improve your instructions or knowledge base

---

### 🔁 8. Iterate Often

The best AI agents are built through feedback:

* Start small and test with real users
* Check your captured leads and inbox regularly
* Refine prompts and flows based on behavior
* Don’t aim for perfect — aim for **useful and evolving**

---

## 9. Voice Settings

* Check mic and audio permissions: Ensure browser or app-level permissions are granted for microphone access.
* Test response delays: Use preview mode to confirm voice response timing is natural.
* Customize tone and pacing: Adjust voice settings to reflect your brand’s communication style.

---

### 🧪 Bonus Tips

* Use short paragraphs and plain language in knowledge content
* Don’t rely on the agent for legal, medical, or sensitive advice
* Set expectations clearly (especially in disclaimers or welcome messages)
* For voice agents: keep answers conversational and less “written” sounding

---

By following these best practices, you'll build an AI agent that’s **engaging, reliable, and aligned with your goals** — not just smart, but also strategic.
